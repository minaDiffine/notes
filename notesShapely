Points Curves Surfaces

A point has a topological dimension of 0 Point class
A curve has a topological dimension of 1 LineStrng and LinearRing class
A surface has a topological dminension of 2 Polygon class

Collections of points are implemented by a MultiPoint class, collections of curves by a MultiLineString class, and collections of surfaces by a MultiPolygon class.

Shapely does not support coordinate system transformations.

interior, boundary, and exterior point set

All operations are performed in the x-y plane. A third z coordinate value may be used when constructing instances, but has no effect on geometric analysis.
 
In all constructors, numeric values are converted to type float

object.area - returns the area (float) of the object

object.bounds - returns a tuple (minx,miny,maxx,maxy) that bounds an object

object.length 

object.minimum_clearance - returnes the smallest distance bu witch a node could be moved to produce an invalid geometry (for point it returns math.infinity)

object.geom_type

object.distance(other)

object.hausdorff_distance(other) - furthest distance that a point on either geometry can be from the nearest point to it on the other geometry

object.representative_point() -     Returns a cheaply computed point that is guaranteed to be within the geometric object.

=!donut.centroid

form shapely import Polygon,Point,LineString

Polygon([[0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], [0, 1], [0, 0]]).minimum_clearance
Point(0, 0).geom_type
Point(0,0).distance(Point(1,1))

-------------------------------------------------------

point = Point(0.0, 0.0)
point.area is 0
point.lenght is 0
point.bounds
list(point.coords)
point.x
point.y
Point(point) - The Point constructor also accepts another Point instance, thereby making a copy.

---------------------------------------------------------

The LineString constructor takes an ordered sequence of 2 or more (x, y[, z]) point tuples.

can be complex (has intersectons with self) and simple

line = LineString([(0, 0), (1, 1)])
line.area
line.length
line.bounds
len(line.coords)
list(line.coords)

line.coords[:] - they can be sliced
LineString(line) - constructor that makes a copy of line

LineString([Point(0.0, 1.0), (2.0, 3.0), Point(4.0, 5.0)]) - this is also valid constructor

----------------------------------------------------------------------

class Polygon(shell[, holes=None])
Rings of a valid Polygon may not cross each other, but may touch at a single point only.

Component rings are accessed via exterior and interiors properties.

polygon = Polygon([(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0)])

list(polygon.exterior.coords)
list(polygon.interiors)

coords = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 0)]
r = LinearRing(coords)
s = Polygon(r)
s.area
t = Polygon(s.buffer(1.0).exterior, [r])

Rectangular polygons occur commonly, and can be conveniently constructed using the shapely.geometry.box() function.

 shapely.geometry.box(minx, miny, maxx, maxy, ccw=True)
 
 shapely.geometry.polygon.orient(polygon, sign=1.0)
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Collections

heterogeneous collections of geom objects may result from some operantions

frozentset-like collections of geometric objects

example:
a = LineString([(0, 0), (1, 1), (1,2), (2,2)])
b = LineString([(0, 0), (1, 1), (2,1), (2,2)])
x = a.intersection(b)

Members of a GeometryCollection are accessed via the geoms property.
list(x.geoms)

when possibel it is better to use homogeneous types

MultiPoint is class that represents a collection of points
points = MultiPoint([(0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)])
list(points.geoms)

MultiLineString is a class that represents collection of LineStrings
coords = [((0, 0), (1, 1)), ((-1, 0), (1, 0))]
lines = MultiLineString(coords)

MultiPoligons is a class that represents collection of Poligons

-------------------------------------------------------

Empty features - almost no operations are supported by empty features
line=LineString()
line.is_empty
line.length
line.bounds - returns (nan,nan,nan,nan)
list(line.coords) - returns an empty list

The list of coordinates that describe a geometry are represented as the CoordinateSequence object

---------------------------------------------------------

object.interpolate(distance[, normalized=False]) - returns a point at the specified distance along a linear geometric object

 object.project(other[, normalized=False]) - suprotno od interpolate

-----------------------------------------------------------

Unary Predicates

object.has_z ex. Point(0,0).has_z returns true or false
object.is_ccw returns true if coordinates are in counter-clockwise order (LinearRing objects only)

A ring with an undesired orientation can be reversed like this:
ring = LinearRing([(0,0), (1,1), (1,0)])
ring.is_ccw
ring2 = LinearRing(list(ring.coords)[::-1])

object.is_empty
from operator import attrgetter
empties = filter(attrgetter('is_empty'), [Point(), Point(0, 0)])
len(list(empties))

 object.is_ring
 object.is_simple - returns true if object does not cross itself
 
 object.is_valid
 ******************
 example wit wraps:
 
 from functools import wraps
 def validate(func):
 	@wraps(func)
 	def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
 		ob=func(*args, **kwargs)
 		if not ob.is_valid:
 			raise TopologicalError("")
 		return ob
 	return wrapper
 	
 @validate
 def ring(cooridnates):
 	return LinearRing(coordinates)
 *******************
 
 Binary Predicates - implemented as methods
 
 object.__eq__(other) - coordinates of two object match precisely
 
 object.equeals(other) -     Returns True if the set-theoretic boundary, interior, and exterior of the object coincide with those of the other.
 
object.equals_exact(other, tolerance)
object.contains(other)

 a.contains(b) == b.within(a)
 
Binary predicates can be used directly as predicates for filter() or itertools.ifilter().

contained = list(filter(line.contains, [Point(), Point(0.5, 0.5)]))

object.covers(other) - similar to contains but doesnt have to contain interior in interior

object.covered_by(other)

object.crosses(other) returns true if interior of object intersects the interior of other but does not contain it and dimensions of intersection is less than dimensions of one or the other

 object.disjoint(other)
 
 object.intersects(other)
 
 object.overlaps(other)
 
 object.touches(other)

object.within(other) - inverse of contains

---------------------------------------------------

DE-9IM Relationships

The relate() method tests all the DE-9IM [4] relationships between objects, of which the named relationship predicates above are a subset.

object.relate(other) -     Returns a string representation of the DE-9IM matrix of relationships between an object’s interior, boundary, exterior and those of another geometric object.

 object.relate_pattern(other, pattern)
--------------------------------------------------------

Spatial Analysis Methods

object.boundary-Returns a lower dimensional object representing the object’s set-theoretic boundary. The boundary of a polygon is a line, the boundary of a line is a collection of points. The boundary of a point is an empty collection.

a = Point(1, 1).buffer(1.5) - krug sa centrom u 1,1 poluprecnika 1.5

 object.centroid
 object.difference(other)
 object.intersection(other)
 object.symmetric_difference(other)
 object.union(other)

a.union(b).boundary
a.boundary.union(b.boundary)

a.boundary.union(b.boundary) less expensive than .union

Several of these set-theoretic methods can be invoked using overloaded operators:

    intersection can be accessed with and, &

    union can be accessed with or, |

    difference can be accessed with minus, -

    symmetric_difference can be accessed with xor, ^

---------------------------------------------------------
Constructive methods

object.buffer(distance, quad_segs=16, cap_style=1, join_style=1, mitre_limit=5.0, single_sided=False) - Returns an approximate representation of all points within a given distance of the this geometric object.

 object.envelope -     Returns a representation of the point or smallest rectangular polygon (with sides parallel to the coordinate axes) that contains the object.

 object.minimum_rotated_rectangle - Returns the general minimum bounding rectangle that contains the object. Unlike envelope this rectangle is not constrained to be parallel to the coordinate axes. If the convex hull of the object is a degenerate (line or point) this degenerate is returned.
 
 object.convex_hull -     Returns a representation of the smallest convex Polygon containing all the points in the object unless the number of points in the object is less than three. For two points, the convex hull collapses to a LineString; for 1, a Point.

object.parallel_offset(distance, side, resolution=16, join_style=1, mitre_limit=5.0) - Returns a LineString or MultiLineString geometry at a distance from the object on its right or its left side.

 object.offset_curve(distance, quad_segs=16, join_style=1, mitre_limit=5.0) - Returns a LineString or MultiLineString geometry at a distance from the object on its right or its left side.
 
  object.simplify(tolerance, preserve_topology=True) -     Returns a simplified representation of the geometric object.

------------------------------------------------------

Affine transformations

shapely.affinity module - collection of affine transform functions

shapely.affinity.affine_transform(geom, matrix) - Returns a transformed geometry using an affine transformation matrix.  

for 2D matrix is formed of: 
    [a, b, d, e, xoff, yoff]

	z'=gx+hy+iz+zoff
	
shapely.affinity.rotate(geom, angle, origin='center', use_radians=False) - Returns a rotated geometry on a 2D plane.

 -----------------------------------------------------------
 
 Rectangle clipping
 
  shapely.ops.clip_by_rect(geom, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) - The geometry is clipped in a fast but possibly dirty way. The output is not guaranteed to be valid. No exceptions will be raised for topological errors.
  
  polygon = Polygon(
    shell=[(0, 0), (0, 30), (30, 30), (30, 0), (0, 0)],
    holes=[[(10, 10), (20, 10), (20, 20), (10, 20), (10, 10)]],)
  clipped_polygon = clip_by_rect(polygon, 5, 5, 15, 15)
  clipped_polygon

---------------------------------------------------------------

The unary_union() function in shapely.ops is more efficient than accumulating with union().

 shapely.ops.unary_union(geoms) - Returns a representation of the union of the given geometric objects.
 
  shapely.ops.triangulate(geom, tolerance=0.0, edges=False) - Returns a Delaunay triangulation of the vertices of the input geometry.
